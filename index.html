      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>I am an experienced data analyst with a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data analysis, and machine learning.
        My expertise lies in Python programming, complemented by proficiency in MySQL and various data visualization tools.
        Over the years, I have honed my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and effectively communicate these
        findings to stakeholders.</p>
      <p> My technical skill set includes data analytics,
        knowledge of data handling and management, working with tools such as Power BI for dashboarding and Jupyter Notebooks
        for data science projects. Additionally, I am adept at using machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and data analysis
        libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
      </p>
      <p>My certifications include the Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst Associate, AWS certified Cloud Practitioner, Certification
        in AIML from DIAT and NIELIT. I am a collaborative team player, continuously improving my problem-solving skills through platforms

      </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I embarked on my data science journey in 2017, starting with an introduction to Python programming during my first
          year of engineering. My passion for uncovering insights from data led me to complete comprehensive training in Python
          and a Data Science and AI bootcamp on Udemy.</p>

        <p>Driven by curiosity, I delved into various tools and technologies within the data science field. I further honed my
          skills by participating in a 6-month course in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at NIELIT Ropar,
          in collaboration with IIT Ropar, where I developed a machine learning model for weather forecasting.</p>

        <p>In addition to my formal education, I cultivated a habit of problem-solving, regularly improving my skills with
          platforms like HackerRank. I became proficient in tools such as Power BI for dashboarding and Jupyter Notebooks for
          data science and machine learning projects. My hands-on experience includes building Power BI dashboards, ML Based Models,
          Data Analysis.</p>
