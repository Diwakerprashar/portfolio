      </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I embarked on my data science journey in 2017, starting with an introduction to Python programming during my first
          year of engineering. My passion for uncovering insights from data led me to complete comprehensive training in Python
          and a Data Science and AI bootcamp on Udemy.</p>

        <p>Driven by curiosity, I delved into various tools and technologies within the data science field. I further honed my
          skills by participating in a 6-month course in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at NIELIT Ropar,
          in collaboration with IIT Ropar, where I developed a machine learning model for weather forecasting.</p>

        <p>In addition to my formal education, I cultivated a habit of problem-solving, regularly improving my skills with
          platforms like HackerRank. I became proficient in tools such as Power BI for dashboarding and Jupyter Notebooks for
          data science and machine learning projects. My hands-on experience includes building Power BI dashboards, ML Based Models,
          Data Analysis.</p>
